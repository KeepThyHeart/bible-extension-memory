/**
 * The next-verse picker - the first rung for a multi-verse passage.
 *
 * "Which verse comes next?" is the cheapest possible test of the thing that
 * actually breaks first when a passage is half-learned: not the words of any
 * one verse, but their ORDER. A user who can recite John 3:16 and John 3:18
 * perfectly and cannot say which follows which has not memorised the passage.
 *
 * Three design decisions in this file are load-bearing and were made
 * explicitly rather than falling out of the implementation:
 *
 * 1. **Candidates show real text, not references.** See `preview`. Recognising
 *    the opening words is the skill being trained; a list of bare references
 *    trains reference recall instead, which is what the `refmatch` rung is
 *    for.
 *
 * 2. **Grading is blocking.** A wrong pick does not advance the session. The
 *    same step is served again, unchanged, until it is answered correctly.
 *    Unlike blanks - where seeing the answer and moving on is the whole point -
 *    an ordering step that let you continue after a miss would teach the wrong
 *    order by leaving it unresolved in the user's head.
 *
 * 3. **The wrong mark is transient.** `StepResult.wrong` carries only the pick
 *    from THIS submission. It is not a tally and it must not accumulate across
 *    retries: its job is to say "not that one" about the thing the user just
 *    clicked. A growing list of crossed-out candidates would turn the exercise
 *    into process-of-elimination, which is a different and much easier task.
