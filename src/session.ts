/**
 * The exercise session: what the user is doing right now.
 *
 * Sessions live in worker memory and are never persisted wholesale. That is
 * deliberate: a half-finished session is not a fact about the user's memory
 * of a passage, it is a fact about a window they had open. What survives a
 * restart is the *resume point* - `cursor`, and the running tally - written to
 * the `resume_state` table after each verse (see `main.ts#submitStep`), not
 * every keystroke. Reconstructing a session from that point does not need to
 * reproduce the exact randomness of steps already graded, only the position
 * and the tally, so a resumed session simply seeds a fresh RNG for whatever
 * comes next.
 *
 * The worker owning the session (rather than the panel) is what makes the
 * pop-out window work at all: a popped-out panel is a fresh document with a
 * fresh iframe, so any state the panel held would be gone. The worker is a
 * long-lived process, so the session survives the panel being moved, closed
 * and reopened.
 *
 * ## Scoring
 *
 * One number, everywhere: **correct first attempts over graded units**. The
 * unit differs by rung - a pick, a blank, a word - but the meaning does not,
 * and a user can be told it in one sentence. Retries after a wrong answer are
 * still recorded but can never earn back the credit, which is what makes a
 * blocking picker honest: you always finish, and finishing is not the same as
 * being right.
 *
 * ## v1: every attempt counts
 *
 * There is no `replay` flag any more. Nothing is locked, so there is no
 * distinction left to draw between "the scheduled attempt" and "practising
 * ahead" - see the task 0004 review, point 4. Every finished session reaches
 * `main.ts#finishSession` and reschedules its card.

   * `refprovide`: parse the typed text via the host and grade against the
   * ACTUAL verse under test, never against anything the panel asserted.
   *
   * Per resolved decision D5, two very different outcomes share this method:
   *
   *   - `parseReference` returns `null` - no book recognised at all. This is
   *     NOT a wrong answer: it does not spoil first-attempt credit (no
   *     `spoil()`, no unit graded at all) and the same step is re-served, as
   *     many times as it takes, with `unrecognized: true` telling the panel
   *     to say so rather than mark it wrong.
   *   - `parseReference` returns a book - even the wrong one, even a book
   *     with no verse pinned down ("John 3") - counts as RECOGNISED and is
   *     graded immediately, right or wrong, like `blanks`/`firstletters`:
   *     single attempt, credit awarded or lost right away, no retry.
   *
   * `parsed.startVerseId`/`endVerseId` - the host's OWN resolved absolute
   * verse ids, not anything decoded here - are what correctness is compared
   * against, so this needs no book/chapter/verse decoding of its own. When
   * the parse names a book but not a specific verse (a whole-chapter
   * reference such as "John 3"), `startVerseId` is absent and the answer is
   * graded wrong: it does not pin down the one verse being asked about, and
   * this module has no way to learn that chapter's verse count without a
   * second host call it has no reason to make just to detect the one-verse
   * chapter edge case, which the standard canon does not contain anyway.
