/**
 * Turning host verse DTOs into the `VerseText` the panel renders.
 *
 * Two things make this more than a field rename.
 *
 * **Tokenisation is a contract, not a convenience.** Scoring compares typed
 * words against `VerseText.words` by index, and the panel renders blanks by
 * index into the same array. If the panel re-split the text it would only take
 * one disagreement about a hyphen for a user to be marked wrong on a word they
 * typed correctly. So the split happens here, once, and the array travels.
 *
 * **The formatting DTO is in transition.** The host historically exposed only
 * a legacy shape - one poetry indent for a whole verse and a bare
 * `sectionHeading` string - which cannot express a line break inside a verse
 * (Psalm 1:1 is three lines) or distinguish a psalm superscription from an
 * editorial heading. A richer block shape is being added. This module reads
 * the block shape when it is there and falls back to the legacy fields when it
 * is not, so the extension runs against either host build and simply renders
 * better against the newer one.
