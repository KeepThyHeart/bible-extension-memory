/**
 * Turning what the user typed into a verse-id range.

 * deceptively deep problem - abbreviations, localised book names, "Ps" versus
 * "Psa" versus "Psalm", roman numerals for the epistles - and a second parser
 * in an extension would disagree with the app's own address bar in ways the
 * user would experience as the extension being broken.
 *
 * What this module does add is the piece the host parser leaves open: a
 * whole-chapter reference ("John 3") comes back with no end verse, because the
 * parser does not know how long the chapter is. `api.bible.listChapters` does,
 * and resolving the two together is the whole job here.
