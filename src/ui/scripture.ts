/**
 * Rendering scripture: poetry, prose, superscriptions and the highlight.
 *
 * This is the one part of the panel that is not chrome, and the rules it
 * follows come from explicit decisions rather than from taste:
 *
 *   - Context is REAL, READABLE TEXT. Not blurred, not greyed into
 *     illegibility, not reduced to grey bars standing in for words. Someone
 *     memorising a passage is memorising it in its setting, and a placeholder
 *     shape teaches nothing.
 *   - The verse being worked on has to be findable at a glance, so it is
 *     highlighted rather than merely "not dimmed". The distinction matters on
 *     a screen where seven other verses are also fully legible.
 *   - Poetry is laid out as poetry. `VerseText.lines` gives inclusive word
 *     ranges at indent levels 1..3, and a Psalm rendered as a wrapped
 *     paragraph loses the parallelism that is half of what makes Hebrew poetry
 *     memorable in the first place.
 *   - Section headings are NOT rendered. The worker does not send them; the
 *     only heading in the data is `psalmTitle`, which is a superscription -
 *     part of the text, and styled as such.
 *
 * Prose flows across verse boundaries into paragraphs, broken where
 * `paragraphStart` says to break. Rendering every prose verse on its own line
 * would be easier and is what ignoring that flag amounts to.
