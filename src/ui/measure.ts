/**
 * Measuring how wide a word is going to be.

 * for a hidden word must be the width of that word, so that revealing the word
 * does not repaginate the passage under the user's eyes. A blank that is
 * visibly too small or too large also leaks the answer's length in a way the
 * exercise does not intend.
 *
 * The obvious implementation - `size={word.length}` or `width: Nch` - is wrong
 * in the way that matters. `ch` is the advance width of "0", so in the
 * proportional face this panel actually renders in, "William" and "illiwam"
 * get the same box despite differing by a third of their width, and every
 * blank in the passage is off by a different amount. The only honest answer is
 * to lay the real string out in the real font and read the result back, which
 * is what {@link WordMeasurer} does with an off-screen span.
 *
 * `estimateTextWidth` is the fallback for when that cannot work - see its own
 * comment - and is pure so it can be tested without a DOM.
