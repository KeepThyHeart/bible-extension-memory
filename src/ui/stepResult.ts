 * Both functions here exist because `types.ts` leaves a genuine ambiguity in
 * the reply, and the panel has to survive either reading of it. They are in
 * their own DOM-free module rather than inside `practiceView.ts` so that they
 * can be tested under vitest's `node` environment, which is where the interest
 * lies: the failure mode is marking the WRONG words red, which looks exactly
 * like a scoring bug in the worker and would be reported as one.
 *
 * Both take a `HiddenWords` description rather than a `BlanksStep`
 * specifically: since task 0004 unified `blanks` and `firstletters` into "some
 * or all of a verse's words are hidden, answered per the active answer mode",
 * the same reveal-and-correct logic applies to both step kinds and to either
 * answer mode's full-word path.

 * step it leaves two readings: positions within the submitted `words` array,
 * or indices into `verse.words`. For a partially-hidden verse those differ
 * (hidden word 0 might be word 4); when every word is hidden they coincide.
 *
 * Rather than guess, both readings are accepted. A value that appears in
 * `hiddenIndices` is taken as a word index and mapped to its position; anything
 * else that is a valid position is taken as a position. The overlap is
 * harmless: when a value is both, the word-index reading is the one that
