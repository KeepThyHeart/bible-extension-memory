/**
 * The exercise runner.
 *
 * Everything else in this panel is a list. This is the part the extension is
 * actually for, and almost every decision in it was made deliberately rather
 * than inherited from a component library, so they are all written down here.
 *
 * LAYOUT. The passage is rendered once, as real scripture, and the exercise
 * happens *inside it*. A blank is an input sitting where its word sits, in its
 * own poetic line; a first-letter slot is the same. There is no answer box
 * below the passage. That arrangement was rejected explicitly, and it is worth
 * being clear about why it is worse than it looks: an answer box detaches what
 * you are typing from the line it belongs to, so the user reads the line, then
 * looks away to type, and the thing being trained - producing the next word
 * while looking at its context - never happens.
 *
 * WIDTHS. Every hidden word is sized to the *measured* width of the word it
 * hides (see `measure.ts`), so revealing it does not move anything. Overtyping
 * grows the input, which can push the rest of that line along; it never
 * repaginates the passage, because the input never gets narrower and the
 * surrounding blocks never change height for a single wrapped line.
 *
 * FEEDBACK. Wrong answers are red with a ✗ beside them, never struck through.
 * Striking through scripture was ruled out, and the reason is a good one - the
 * user's mistake gets a mark, but the words of the verse are not defaced.
 *
 * BLOCKING vs ADVANCING. The picker blocks: a wrong pick is marked so you can
 * see which one you clicked, and the same step comes back. The mark is
 * transient by design - it says "not that one", it does not keep a tally on
 * screen, and it is gone before the retry. The typed exercises do not block;
 * they show what was missed and move on.
 *
 * ## v1: one hidden-word mechanic, two answer modes
 *
 * `blanks` and `firstletters` used to be built out of two unrelated pieces of
 * code - one that showed the initial as a spoiler and asked you to retype it,
 * and one that asked for a whole word behind a Check button. Task 0004's
 * review called the first one out as a bug ("the first letters shouldn't be
 * visible") and asked for the two activities to differ only in *how many*
 * words are hidden, never in *how* a hidden word is answered. So there is now
 * one mechanic, `buildHiddenWordRenderer`, driven by `Step.answerMode`:
 *
 *   - `firstLetter` (the default) - a one-character box per hidden word, never
 *     pre-filled with anything. A correct letter reveals the whole word and
 *     moves on automatically; there is no Check button because there is
 *     nothing left to confirm once every box is resolved.
 *   - `fullWord` - a full-word box per hidden word, graded leniently on
 *     spelling but not on the letters themselves, confirmed with Check - this
 *     is what all of `blanks` looked like in v0.
