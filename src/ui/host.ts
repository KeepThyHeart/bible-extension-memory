/**
 * What a view is allowed to ask of the panel.
 *
 * The four screens do not talk to the SDK, the clock or each other. They are
 * handed this, and it is the entire surface they get. That is worth the extra
 * indirection for two reasons: the views stay renderable in a test harness
 * with a stub host, and - more practically - it keeps the number of places
 * that can start a session, mutate navigation or read `Date.now()` down to one
 * file, `panel.ts`, instead of four.
 *
 * `now()` is on the interface rather than being called directly for the same
 * reason `format.ts` takes a `now` argument: a screen that reads the clock
 * itself cannot be shown a fixed moment.
