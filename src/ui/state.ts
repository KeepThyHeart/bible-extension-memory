 * would fight the host's own navigation. So view state is an ordinary value
 * and this module is an ordinary reducer over it - which has the pleasant side
 * effect that "where does leaving an activity return to?" is a pure function
 * with a unit test rather than a variable someone forgot to reset.
 *
 * DOM-free on purpose; see the note at the top of `format.ts`.
