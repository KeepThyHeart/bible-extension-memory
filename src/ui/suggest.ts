/**
 * Pure "what should the shuffled deck serve next" logic.
 *
 * Same discipline as `format.ts`: nothing here touches the DOM, and nothing
 * here reads the clock or the RNG itself - `now` and `rng` always arrive as
 * arguments, so a fixed seed and a fixed clock make every draw reproducible
 * in a test.
 *
 * This module answers three different questions that look similar but are
 * not the same button:
 *
 *   - `listTargets`         - every (passage, activity) pair currently on
 *                              offer, so a caller can build its own pool.
 *   - `pickShuffledTarget`  - "give me something to practise now", weighted
 *                              30% toward what's due, 70% toward anything
 *                              applicable - the "shuffle" behind a session
 *                              that keeps serving fresh cards.
 *   - `pickTargetForActivity` - "start *this* activity specifically", for a
 *                              dropdown that names the rung up front.
