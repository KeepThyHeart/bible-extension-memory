/**
 * The two mastery ladders, and the five-level scale used to display progress
 * on each rung.
 *
 * `DesignSpec.md` originally described one ladder for everything. That was
 * wrong for a reason worth stating plainly: **reordering does not make sense
 * for a single verse**. There is nothing to put in order. Equally, matching a
 * reference to its text needs other references to choose between, so it is
 * meaningless for a passage that is the only thing in the collection.
 *
 * So there are two first rungs, chosen by the shape of the material, and the
 * ladders converge afterwards:
 *
 *     multi-verse passage:   ordering  -> blanks -> firstletters
 *     single verse, siblings: refmatch -> blanks -> firstletters
 *     single verse, alone:               blanks -> firstletters
 *
 * The third case is not a rounding error - it is the state of every plan on
 * the day it is created, because the first thing added is always alone.
 *
 * ## v1: no locks, no promotion
 *
 * The task 0004 review asked for every rung to be practisable at any time -
 * nothing "unlocks", nothing is a warning, and skipping ahead is encouraged
 * rather than merely tolerated. So this file no longer has a promotion
 * threshold or a `CardState`; it has `levelFromScore`, a pure function from
 * "how well did the last attempt go" to a 0-5 display level, and
 * `applicableRungs` is unchanged because *which* rungs exist is still a
 * property of the material, not of how far the user has come.
 *
 * ## v2: tiers, and a level that cannot fall
 *
 * Two activities were added (`refprovide` joins `refmatch` as a reference
 * activity, both gated on `MIN_VERSES_FOR_REFERENCE_ACTIVITIES`), and every
 * activity gained *tiers* - harder renderings of the same exercise.
 *
 * With tiers, "what level is this activity" stopped being a function of one
 * score. It is now `levelForActivity`, derived from per-tier bests over the
 * whole history: how much of the activity has been passed, weighted by how
 * accurately. Because every input is a MAX or a COUNT, the level cannot fall
 * on its own - a bad session shortens the interval and leaves the level
 * alone. The single exception is an explicit reset
 * (`store.ts#resetPassageProgress`), which moves each card's
 * `progress_reset_at` forward so the history before it stops counting.
 *
 * `levelFromScore` survives, because the single-tier case still is a pure
 * accuracy question, and because `card.state`'s human-readable label is still
 * written from it.

/**
 * The 0-5 level one activity displays, derived from its whole history.

 * ## The formula (resolved decision - do not substitute another)
 *
 * The original plan proposed `1 + round(4 * tiersPassed / totalTiers)` for a
 * multi-tier activity, i.e. completeness alone. The user's resolved answer
 * overrides that: completeness is multiplied by accuracy, so grinding every
 * tier badly does not read the same as passing every tier well.
 *
 *     multi-tier (totalTiers > 1):
 *       completeness = tiersPassed / totalTiers          (0 when attempts = 0)
 *       score        = completeness
 *                      * MAX(overallAccuracy, hardestTierPassedAccuracy)
 *       level        = clamp(1 + round(4 * score), 1, 5)
 *
 *     single-tier (totalTiers === 1):
 *       level        = levelFromScore(bestScore)
 *
 *     no attempts at all: level 0, in both cases.
 *
 * Worked example, because it is the one that surprises people: one attempt at
 * 100% on tier 0 of a two-tier activity gives completeness 0.5 and accuracy
 * 1.0, so score 0.5 and level **3** - not 5. A perfect run of the easy tier is
 * genuinely half of the activity, and the level says so. Passing the harder
 * tier as well takes completeness to 1.0 and the level to 5.
 *
 * ## The two judgement calls the decision left open
 *
 * 1. **"Overall accuracy" is the BEST score across attempts**, not the mean
 *    and not the latest. The instruction was to take the most favourable
 *    reasonable reading that is consistent with non-regression, and only a MAX
 *    is monotonic: a mean falls when a good session is followed by a bad one.
 * 2. **The 1-5 scaling is `1 + round(4 * score)`**, not `levelFromScore`.
 *    `levelFromScore` maps *accuracy* to a level and its thresholds are bunched
 *    at the top (0.9 is already level 4), which is right for "how well did you
 *    recall this" and wrong for a completeness-weighted score, where 0.5 means
 *    "half done well" and belongs in the middle of the scale rather than at
 *    level 2. `levelFromScore` is kept for the single-tier path, which IS pure
 *    accuracy.
 *
 * ## Non-regression
 *
 * There is no stored high-water mark, and there deliberately is not one: every
 * input is a MAX or a COUNT over the attempts that survive the card's
 * `progress_reset_at`, both factors of the product are non-decreasing, so the
 * level cannot fall on its own. A bad session still shortens the *interval*
 * (`scheduler.ts` reads the attempt's own score), it just does not lower the
 * level. The only thing that lowers a level is
 * `store.ts#resetPassageProgress`, which moves the reset point forward and
 * makes the history before it stop counting.
