/**
 * Domain types and the panel <-> worker protocol.
 *
 * This file is the contract between the two halves of the extension and is
 * deliberately the first thing written. The worker owns all state, all
 * persistence and all scoring; the panel owns pixels and nothing else. Every
 * message below crosses `api.panels.postMessage` / `BibleExtUI.postToWorker`,
 * which means two hard constraints:
 *
 *   1. Everything here must be structured-cloneable JSON. No class instances,
 *      no functions, no `Date` (epoch milliseconds instead), no `undefined`
 *      inside arrays.
 *   2. Messages are capped at 256 KB each way. A whole book of verse text
 *      would blow that, so the panel asks for one passage's context at a time
 *      and never for a book.
 *
 * ## v1: nothing is locked
 *
 * The original design gated a rung behind two consecutive passes of the one
 * before it (`CardState.locked`, `shouldPromote`). The human review of that
 * design (task 0004) asked for it to be dropped entirely: every activity is
 * always practisable, every attempt counts and reschedules, and a harder
 * activity's level simply carries over into the passage's overall "well
 * learned" status. There is therefore no `locked` state and no `replay`
 * concept any more - see `ladder.ts` for the five-level scale that replaced
 * the four-state one.

/**
 * One rung of a mastery ladder.
 *
 * There are two ladders, not one, and they converge after the first rung. Which
 * first rung applies is a property of the *material*, not of the user:
 *
 *   - `ordering`  - a multi-verse passage. "Which verse comes next?"
 *   - `refmatch`  - given the words, choose the reference. Needs a big enough
 *                   scope to draw plausible distractors from.
 *   - `blanks`    - shared second rung. Type the missing words.
 *   - `firstletters` - shared third rung. Every word is a blank.
 *   - `refprovide` - given the words, *supply* the reference from memory. The
 *                    hardest reference activity, and the only single-tier one.
 *
 * Reordering a single verse is meaningless and the two reference activities
 * need enough material in scope to be more than a formality, so a lone single
 * verse in a collection can do none of them and starts at `blanks`. That edge
 * case is why `firstRungFor` exists rather than a constant.
 *
 * Which rungs a passage has *cards* for is a property of the material alone
 * (`ladder.ts#materialRungs`); which of those *apply* right now is recomputed
 * on every read (`ladder.ts#applicableRungs`), because it depends on facts -
 * how many verses are in scope, how many sibling passages exist - that change
