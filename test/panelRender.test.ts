/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * Rendering tests: the part of the panel that had never been executed.
 *
 * `panel.test.ts` covers the panel's *decisions* - which card is next, how a
 * date reads, how an ambiguous `StepResult` maps back onto answers - and says
 * in its own header that none of the rendering, none of the event handling and
 * none of the measurement is covered because "those need a browser". They do,
 * and this file supplies one. The exercises are what the extension is for and
 * essentially all of their behaviour lives in the DOM, so a suite that stops at
 * the pure helpers is testing the easy half.
 *
 * The pragma above turns on `jsdom` for this file only rather than changing
 * `vitest.config.ts`: the rest of the suite is deliberately DOM-free (see the
 * note at the top of `format.ts`) and giving every test a document would
 * quietly remove the pressure that keeps the logic testable.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHAT IS NOT. These tests assert what a user would
 * experience - the words on screen, which element is distinguished from its
 * neighbours, what a screen reader would be given, whether an input is sized to
 * its word - and avoid asserting on class names or markup shape wherever the
 * behaviour can be reached another way. Class names are used to *locate* nodes
 * in a couple of places where nothing else identifies them; they are not the
 * thing being checked.
 *
 * WHAT JSDOM CANNOT DO, stated once here rather than implied at each site:
 *
 *   - It has no layout engine. Every `getBoundingClientRect()` is zero, which
 *     is exactly the condition `WordMeasurer.measure` documents as "the panel
 *     is not being laid out" and falls back from. So the width assertions
 *     below exercise the documented fallback (`estimateTextWidth`) and check
 *     that it is proportional and respects its floor. A real pixel width for a
 *     real font cannot be produced here and is not claimed.
 *   - It does not resolve `var()`. Computed colours come back as the literal
 *     token reference, so "is this red?" is answered by following the token to
 *     the hex fallback declared in `styles.css`.
 *   - It does not evaluate `::after { content }`. The ✗ on a *picker*
 *     candidate is drawn that way, so the picker tests assert the candidate is
 *     visually distinguished from its siblings rather than looking for a glyph
 *     that jsdom will never generate. (The ✗ inside a missed *word* is a real
 *     text node and is asserted directly.)
 *
 * The panel's real stylesheet is loaded into the document, because several of
 * the decisions being guarded here - poetry indentation, context that is legible
 * rather than blurred, and above all the absence of any strike-through - are
 * expressed in CSS and would be reintroduced there, not in TypeScript.
