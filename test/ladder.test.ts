/**
 * Ladder-shape and level tests.
 *
 * The single fact the `applicableRungs` block exists to protect is that there
 * are TWO ladders, not one, and which one applies is a property of the
 * *material* rather than of the user. A regression back to one ladder would
 * not throw anywhere - it would simply hand a user a single verse and ask
 * them to put it in order, which is not a question. So the shape is asserted
 * directly rather than inferred from anything downstream.
 *
 * The case that gets the most attention below is the third one - a single
 * verse ALONE in the collection, which starts at `blanks` because neither
 * first rung is possible. That is not an exotic edge case: it is the state of
 * every plan on the day it is created, because the first passage a user adds
 * is necessarily the only passage. A `firstRungFor` that returned `refmatch`
 * unconditionally for single verses would break the very first thing every
 * user of this extension ever does, and would do it silently, by handing them
 * a picker with one option.
 *
 * The `levelFromScore` block replaced what used to be `shouldPromote` /
 * `cardStateFor` - task 0004 dropped locks and promotion entirely in favour of
 * a five-level display derived straight from the last score.
