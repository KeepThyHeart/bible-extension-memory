/**
 * Scheduling tests.
 *
 * `scheduler.ts` is a fixed interval ladder rather than SM-2, and the value of
 * that choice is *legibility*: a user can be told "you will see this again in
 * a week" and it will be true. So the tests below assert concrete positions on
 * `INTERVALS_DAYS` rather than "the interval got bigger" - a test phrased as an
 * inequality would pass just as happily against the ease-factor drift the
 * design deliberately rejected.
 *
 * The jitter block is the substantial one. Jitter looks decorative and is not:
 * without it the ladder is fully deterministic, so a cohort of passages added
 * on one Sunday afternoon advances in lockstep and comes due together for the
 * life of the plan. That failure is invisible in any single-card test - every
 * card is individually correct - so it is asserted directly, by scheduling two
 * cards at the same instant with the same interval and requiring them to
 * separate.
